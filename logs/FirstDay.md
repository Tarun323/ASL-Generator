# First Day of planning.
The idea is to create a GUI for generating Amazon State Language JSON. 
The GUI will feature simple drag and drop tools to model a workflow. 
The user will be able to export this workflow into JSON. 
Also it should work the other way around as well. 
i.e. the users can inupt a ASL JSON and it is visualized. 

I am doing this because as of now (21/06/2020) there are no tools that let me do this. 
I recently tried to use ASL in one of my work projects. Even though we decided against using it.
Yet I feel I should try to create this tool to expand my UI knowledge and in the hopes that someone might find it useful.

I currently have only created UI for dektop applications. 
I have no experience with web UIs and very little experience with JS.
I have mostly worked on backends with Java, Python and C#.

I plan on using React. Since it seems popular. 
I decided against Angular since it changes so often.
